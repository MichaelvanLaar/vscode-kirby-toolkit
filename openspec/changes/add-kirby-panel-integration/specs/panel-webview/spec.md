### Requirement: External Browser Access
The extension SHALL provide a command to open the Kirby Panel in the user's default web browser as an alternative to WebView.

#### Scenario: Open Panel in browser
- **WHEN** user executes "Kirby: Open Panel in Browser" command
- **THEN** the extension SHALL detect the Panel URL using the same detection logic
- **AND** open the URL in the default system browser using `vscode.env.openExternal()`
