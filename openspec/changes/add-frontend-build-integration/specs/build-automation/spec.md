# Specification: Build Automation

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Build Script Detection
The extension SHALL automatically detect frontend build scripts from the workspace's package.json file.

#### Scenario: Detect dev script
- **WHEN** extension activates in a workspace containing a package.json
- **AND** package.json contains a `scripts.dev` field
- **THEN** the extension SHALL identify this as the primary development build script

#### Scenario: Detect watch script as fallback
- **WHEN** package.json does not contain a `scripts.dev` field
- **AND** package.json contains a `scripts.watch` field
- **THEN** the extension SHALL identify this as the development build script

#### Scenario: Detect frontend-specific scripts
- **WHEN** package.json contains multiple scripts like `dev`, `dev:css`, `watch:css`
- **THEN** the extension SHALL prioritize scripts with suffixes suggesting frontend builds (`:css`, `:js`, `:assets`)
- **AND** prefer `dev` > `watch` > `dev:css` > `watch:css` in priority order

#### Scenario: Detect build script for one-time compilation
- **WHEN** package.json contains a `scripts.build` field
- **THEN** the extension SHALL identify this as the one-time build script
- **AND** use it for "Run Build Once" commands

#### Scenario: No build scripts found

- **AND** allow manual configuration via `kirby.buildCommand` setting

### Requirement: Terminal-Based Process Management
The extension SHALL use VS Code's Terminal API to run build processes for better user experience and integration.

- **THEN** the extension SHALL set build status to "ready"

#### Scenario: Error state
- **WHEN** build terminal closes unexpectedly (before user stops it manually)
- **THEN** the extension SHALL set build status to "error"

### Requirement: Status Bar Integration
The extension SHALL display build status in VS Code's status bar for quick visibility.

### Requirement: Build Commands
The extension SHALL provide commands for manual build process control.

#### Scenario: Start build watcher command
- **WHEN** user executes "Kirby: Start Build Watcher" command
- **AND** build script is detected from package.json
- **THEN** the extension SHALL start the build terminal with the detected script

#### Scenario: Run build once command
- **WHEN** user executes "Kirby: Run Build Once" command
- **THEN** the extension SHALL execute the one-time build script (e.g., `npm run build`)
- **AND** create a terminal named "Kirby Build (once)"
- **AND** NOT mark this as a persistent build watcher

#### Scenario: Show build terminal command
- **WHEN** user executes "Kirby: Show Build Terminal" command
- **AND** a "Kirby Build" terminal exists
- **THEN** the extension SHALL reveal and focus the terminal

#### Scenario: Missing build script error
- **WHEN** user executes a build command
- **AND** no build script is detected or configured
- **THEN** the extension SHALL display an error notification: "No build script found. Configure via kirby.buildCommand setting."
- **AND** provide action button [Configure Build Command]

### Requirement: Auto-Start Configuration
The extension SHALL support automatic build watcher startup when opening a workspace.

#### Scenario: Auto-start disabled by default
- **WHEN** extension activates in a Kirby workspace
- **AND** `kirby.buildAutoStart` setting is false (default)
- **THEN** the extension SHALL NOT automatically start the build watcher

#### Scenario: Auto-start enabled
