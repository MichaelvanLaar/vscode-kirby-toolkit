# Add Non-Functional Requirements

## Why

The Kirby CMS Developer Toolkit currently has three feature-specific capability specifications (type-hint-injection, blueprint-support, snippet-navigation) that focus on functional behavior, but lacks formal documentation of cross-cutting quality attributes and non-functional requirements that apply to all features. Without explicit NFRs, there's no shared understanding of performance targets, maintainability standards, compatibility constraints, or user experience principles that should guide development across all toolkit features.

As the toolkit grows with new features (API IntelliSense, Panel Integration, Build Automation, etc.), these quality standards become increasingly important to maintain consistency, prevent technical debt, and ensure a cohesive user experience.

## What Changes

This change introduces a new **Quality Attributes** specification that codifies five cross-cutting non-functional requirements:

1. **Performance** - File system operations must execute efficiently without noticeable delays (<500ms for most operations)
2. **Code Maintainability** - Lean implementation with modular architecture supporting future expansion
3. **Implementation Feasibility** - Core features must be rapidly prototypable using standard VS Code patterns
4. **Compatibility** - Seamless integration with existing tooling (Intelephense, Tailwind IntelliSense, RedHat YAML)
5. **User Experience** - Guided experience with contextual help for developers new to Kirby

These requirements will serve as evaluation criteria for all current and future features, ensuring consistent quality across the toolkit.

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: New capability `quality-attributes` (cross-cutting)
- **Affected code**: No immediate code changes; this is a documentation/specification change that establishes standards for all features
- **Configuration**: No new settings required
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Breaking changes**: None (additive specification)
- **Testing**: NFRs will inform test suite design (performance benchmarks, integration tests, etc.)
- **Future features**: All new features must demonstrate compliance with these NFRs in their proposals

**Note:** This is a specification-only change that documents existing implicit standards and makes them explicit. No implementation tasks are required, but future feature development will reference these requirements.
