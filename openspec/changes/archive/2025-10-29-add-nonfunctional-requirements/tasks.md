# Implementation Tasks: Non-Functional Requirements

## Note on Implementation

This is a **specification-only change** that codifies existing quality standards. There are no code changes required for this proposal. The tasks below focus on documentation and process integration.

## 1. Specification Documentation
- [x] 1.1 Create quality-attributes specification in `openspec/specs/quality-attributes/spec.md`
- [x] 1.2 Document Performance requirement with quantified time budgets
- [x] 1.3 Document Code Maintainability requirement with architectural principles
- [x] 1.4 Document Implementation Feasibility requirement
- [x] 1.5 Document Compatibility requirement with integration testing approach
- [x] 1.6 Document User Experience requirement with guided experience principles

## 2. Project Documentation Updates
- [x] 2.1 Update `openspec/project.md` to reference new quality-attributes spec
- [x] 2.2 Add cross-reference in project.md "Important Constraints" section to NFRs
- [x] 2.3 Update project.md "Testing Strategy" section to mention NFR-driven testing
- [x] 2.4 Add link to quality-attributes spec in main README.md (if appropriate)

## 3. Validation and Approval
- [x] 3.1 Validate OpenSpec change with `openspec validate add-nonfunctional-requirements --strict`
- [x] 3.2 Review specification with project stakeholders
- [x] 3.3 Confirm NFRs align with existing implemented features (type-hints, blueprints, snippets)
- [x] 3.4 Verify NFRs are referenced in pending feature proposals (API IntelliSense, Panel Integration, etc.)

## 4. Archive
- [ ] 4.1 After approval and merge, archive change with `openspec archive add-nonfunctional-requirements`
- [ ] 4.2 Verify quality-attributes spec appears in `openspec/specs/` directory
- [ ] 4.3 Confirm `openspec list --specs` includes quality-attributes in output
